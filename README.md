# Block-chain-stu-portal

Students own credentials in a Passport Wallet → Issuers use a Portal to mint verifiable credentials (on-chain pointer + encrypted metadata off-chain) → Verifiers use a public tool to request proof → Student creates a ZKP (selective disclosure) to prove attributes → Verifier validates ZKP and checks issuer trust via DAO-backed Issuer Registry → system supports revocation/expiry and cross-chain portability.
